Small Steamworks is a Unity package based on [Steamworks.NET](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET). It is designed to wrap Steamworks.NET in a easy-to-use callback and async wrapper. It aims to make the Steamworks API easier to use by doing a lot of the heavy lifting for you with only a few methods and properties.

## Installation

See the [installation](installation) page for more information.

## Features

Small Steamworks is currently in development. The features listed below are already implemented and working. If a feature isn't listed, you can still use Steamworks.NET directly.

### [Achievements](achievements)
Achievements are fully implemented and working. Use achievements to track the progress of your users.

### [Friends](friends)
Friends have the important parts already, but not all functions are implemented. Use friends to get information about other Steam users in game.

### [Leaderboards](leaderboards)
Leaderboards are fully implemented and working. Use leaderboards to track the high scores of your users.

### [Stats](stats)
Stats are fully implemented and working. Use stats to track the progress of your users.

### [Storage](storage)
Storage is partially implemented. Use storage to save and load data from the cloud.
