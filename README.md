# Small Steamworks

Small Steamworks is an easy-to-use wrapper for the Steamworks API, based on [Steamworks.NET](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET). That means all assets that use Steamworks.NET works out of the box!

It's designed to be easy to use and to make it easy to add Steamworks support to your game using callbacks and normal C# `async`.
